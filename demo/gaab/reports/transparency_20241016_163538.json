Centene price increase: Represents unbilled revenue relating to price increases negotiated with Centene for Jan'21 to Apr'21 (subsequently agreed to and billed in May'21), excluded from working capital given that this is a non-recurring balance.\\n2. Advance from BCBSNJ-horizon commercial: Target had received a one-time prepayment of USD 3 million from its customer BCBSNJ-horizon commercial in Dec-19 for invoices to be issued from Jan'20 to Dec'20, in exchange for a 2% discount on billings in CY20. Such advance received was recorded as a reduction from the receivables balance from Dec'19 to Dec'20. Given the one-off nature of this arrangement, we have sought to normalize the receivables for the above period for such quarterly advance balances, and in its place, have factored in a normalized receivables balance based on trailing quarter revenue from BSBSNJ-horizon commercial at each quarter end and DSO as at 30 April 2021.\\n3. One-off receivables: Represents receivables relating to non-recurring COVID-19 related revenue earned in CY20, excluded from working capital. (Refer to adjustment 15 in the Quality of earnings section). In the absence of quarterly receivable details by customer, and based on average credit period of 30 \\u2013 60 days across key customers, we have assumed receivables from (i) First National Bank of Texas to have been collected as at Sep'20 (i.e. within 60-90 days from billings in June 2020) and (ii) K12 to have been outstanding as at Sep'20 (having been largely billed in August and September 2020)\\n| | Mar-20 | Jun-20 | Sep-20 | Dec-20 |\\n|-|-|-|-|-|\\n| First National Bank of Texas | 0.0 | 0.5 | - | - |\\n| Humana Other | - | - | - | 0.6 |\\n| K12 | - | - | 0.5 | 0.2 |\\n| Total | 0.0 | 0.5 | 0.5 | 0.8 |\\nSource: Management information\\n4. Stretched payables: Payables outstanding for more than 90 days as at Dec'19, Dec'20 and Apr'21 have been excluded and considered debt like as discussed in adjustment 10 in the Adjusted net debt section. In the absence of details of stretched payables as at each quarter end, we have assumed the quarterly balances to have been similar to the respective financial year end balances.\\n5. Change in business model in Mexico : Till November 2020, target operated in Mexico through a shelter services agreement with Intugo (formerly known as Offshore group), primarily to help with providing subcontracted staff, leasing of facilities etc. Target transitioned to an in-house resourcing model in Q4'20 with the incorporation of its own entity in Mexico. We have excluded the quarterly historical payable balances towards Intugo (Offshore Group) to arrive at the normalized working capital under the new operating mode. Refer Appendix 15.\\n6. Capex payables: As discussed in adjustment 4 in the Adjusted net debt section, we have excluded payables towards capital expenditures as at Dec'19, Dec'20 and Apr'21. Details of quarterly capex payables was not made available to us, due to which we have assumed the quarterly capex payables to be equivalent to the balances as at the respective financial year ends.\\n7. One-off payables: Represents management fee payable to existing private equity investors (One Equity Partners) as discussed in adjustment 6 in the Quality of earnings section.\\n8. Due from Vangtel (former name for Intugo / Offshore group): Refer adjustment 3 in the Adjusted net debt section\\n9.
